_Understanding femininity has been quite a long journey for me._ Since my high school years, I denied every feminine sign that I could possibly give off to society. My behavior, gestures, and appearance started to evolve into a more masculine look, rather than feminine. Why? Because I understood that I wouldn't be able to "Be Someone" in this world unless I acted like a man. 

In this blog post, I want to talk about how I started to **embrace my femininity**, and how this helped me to overcome my fears and surrender to my greatest power. We will delve into the challenges and misconceptions surrounding femininity and discuss how we can overcome them without losing our **greatest power**.

## Is it Possible to Define Femininity?

Femininity encompasses those traits and behaviors that define a woman as a woman. I know this might be confusing, especially nowadays that defining what a woman is has become more and more difficult (By the way, have you seen the Documentary ["What Is A Woman"](https://www.documentaryarea.com/player.php/player.php?title=What%20Is%20a%20Woman)? I highly recommend it to dive deeper into this topic)attributed to women. However, the understanding of femininity goes beyond stereotypes and encompasses a wide range of expressions. We will examine the societal context in which femininity exists and the impact it has on individuals.

## What is Feminine? 

Over the years, the traditional roles and expectations placed on women have shifted. Women are now taking on leadership positions, pursuing higher education, and making significant contributions to various fields. Women have rights and can contribute to their society equally (unfortunately, not everywhere is like this. My point of reference is in Western countries), and they also contribute to the family income. 

The inclusiveness of women in what is known to be traditionally the men's habitat forces women to unconsciously adopt a more aggressive, ambitious, objective-focused way of living, ultimately, more masculine. **Women have to act like men to be seen as equal in the workplace**.
