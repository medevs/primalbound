_I took this photo on the train in Thailand a few days ago._ Don't worry; there is no need to go that far. You will experience the same situation in the public transportation in your city. This is the reality we are used to: People are connected, but not with their present moment. You could see they were somewhere else: in a thousand places, with hundreds of people that aren't on that train.  

In this post, we will talk about social media's impact on us, and how we can turn that effect to the positive side. Is it possible to use social media consciously? If so, how can we do it? Keep reading to find out.

## Let's face it: Social media are designed to be addictive
You may think you can control the time spent on social media, but in fact, **you always stay longer than you have planned**. This is because social media have been designed to be addictive. As Dr. Cal Newport states in his book [Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692), social media is designed to fragment your attention as much as possible throughout your waking hours, and this has an impact on decreasing your focus on tasks that require more than 10 minutes attention along the day. 

## This is why you think social media are necessary in your life
Living in a fast-paced, technology-oriented world, we believe social media are helpful, valuable tools whose adverse effects we must inevitably accept. Here are two reasons why you think social media are necessary in your life: 

**1. Without social media, I fear missing out (FOMO) on many things."** _Reality is_: Important events will come your way despite social media. Also, think about the time you spend on social media for informative purposes vs. the time you use social media for recreational purposes. We suggest **filtering the information that reaches you** by, for example, subscribing to a newsletter or specialized app like [feedly](https://feedly.com/), where you can curate the news by interest. 

**2. I need social media to succeed personally and professionally.** _Reality is_: With the amount of information an average user receives from social media, it is improbable that someone will remember your brand the next day. Try to follow strategies that differentiate you from other brands, which may impact outside social media world. The truth is, **being on social media nowadays is the least creative form of advertisement**. 

**3. With social media, I can connect with people worldwide and make friends.** _Reality is_: Social media creates a false sense of connection and belonging, simply because it lacks physical presence. It will keep your mind occupied as long as you are using them, but your sense of loneliness will increase at the end of the day. 

## The adverse effects of social media on you

We can, therefore, say there are negative effects that social media bring with them, and those are: 

- Input of **constant stimuli** that causes **fragmented attention**.
- **Intermittent rewards** in the form of likes, notifications, and comments that keep us addicted.
- **Fake feeling of connectedness**.
- **Comparison with unreal standards**.

## A Guide to Implementing Conscious Use of Social Media

### Reflect on your current social media habits

Taking a step back and reflecting on your current social media habits is important. Consider how often you find yourself scrolling through your feeds, how much time you spend on social media each day, and how it impacts your overall well-being. **By understanding your current habits,** you can start to make more conscious choices about your social media usage.

### Define your purpose for using social media

In previous posts, we discuss the importance of taking actions that align with our life purpose. Reflect on your purpose of using social media as well: Are you using it for personal connection, professional networking, or creative inspiration? **Understanding your goals** allows you to align your social media usage accordingly and avoid getting caught up in mindless scrolling.

**Identify specific accounts, topics, or communities** that align with your interests and values. This will make your social media experience more meaningful and help you avoid getting overwhelmed by irrelevant or negative content.

### Unfollow or muting accounts that don't align with your values

One of the keys to a conscious social media experience is curating your feed to only include accounts that align with your values. If you constantly compare yourself to certain accounts or feel drained by their content, consider unfollowing or muting them. Surround yourself with accounts that inspire and uplift you.

### Follow accounts that inspire and educate you

On the flip side, actively seek out accounts that inspire and educate you. Look for content creators, thought leaders, or organizations that share valuable insights, positive messages, or helpful resources. By following these accounts, you can create a feed that enriches your life and promotes personal growth.

### Establish time limits and define usage periods

It's crucial to set clear time limits and designated usage periods to prevent social media from taking over your life. Determine how much time you want to spend on social media daily and establish boundaries around when and how you engage with it. This way, you can maintain a healthy balance between your online and offline life.

For this, we recommend the app [stayfree](https://stayfreeapps.com/). You can have an overview of the apps that you most spend time with, block apps, and establish a timeline of usage. 

### Be present and intentional while using social media

When you do engage with social media, strive to be present and intentional. Avoid mindlessly scrolling and instead take the time to fully engage with the content you encounter. Like, comment, and share thoughtfully, fostering meaningful connections and conversations.

Mindless scrolling can easily become a habit that detracts from our well-being. Be mindful of how much time you spend scrolling and set limits for yourself. Additionally, avoid falling into the comparison trap. Remember that social media often showcases the highlights of people's lives, and it's important to focus on your own journey rather than comparing yourself to others.

Social media can be a platform for meaningful conversations and interactions. Take the opportunity to engage in discussions, share your thoughts, and connect with others who have similar interests or passions. By fostering genuine connections, you can make social media a more positive and impactful part of your life.
